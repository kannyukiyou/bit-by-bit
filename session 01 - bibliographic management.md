### Zotero.

"[Zotero](www.zotero.org) [zoh-TAIR-oh] is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, cite, and share your research sources. It lives right where you do your work in the web browser itself." 

After [downloading](https://www.zotero.org/download/) 1) the stand-alone version and the corollary connectors for Chrome, Firefox, or Safari or 2) the Zotero-Firefox version, we will also discuss [plug-ins](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration) for popular wordprocessing software as Microsoft Word and LibreOffice. Students are also encouraged to experiment with [embedding Zotero within Overleaf Latex documents](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/174-import-your-bibs-reference-management-tools-now-linked-to-overleaf-number-backtoschool). 

This session also discusses zotero for mobile and a Zotero-fork, i.e. [Multilingual Zotero](http://citationstylist.org/). 
Also handy: [Zotfile](http://zotfile.com/), a "Zotero plugin to manage your attachments".

alternatives: [students are encouraged to compare alternative software packages with Zotero, discuss pros and cons, ]: Mendeley, ....
